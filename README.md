H20 is a modern full stack starter kit with simple server side rendering and fully featured boilerplate code for a universal application (both server and client side). Based on Node.js and React, among other things.

## Why H20?

You can think of H20 as a full stack starter kit for projects that fits into a few different use cases. Here are some of the best ways to take full advantage of H20.

You're building an application that you need fine grained control over which data you need to pre-render from your backend to your frontend.

You need to get started quickly with both a backend Node.js server and a frontend based on React with most configuration already set up.

You want to skip the setup involved with configuring Babel/Webpack but still would like to have the customization and flexibility it offers.

You want to reap the performance benefits of server side rendering, but then have the browser take over once the JavaScript has loaded for full UI interactivity.

You want to be able to jump between frontend code and backend code within the same file structure.

You want your app to load as fast as possible by taking advantage of Webpack to compress JavaScript into the smallest possible files in production.

And of course much more.

## Stack

### Node.js
We use Node for it's robust backend server technology.

### Express
We use Express for handling both API requests and url requests for your app.

### MongoDB
We use MongoDB for database. There isn't much database code in this starter but a lot is preconfigured.

### React
We use React for our frontend JavaScript framework. It works especially well when coupled with server side rendering, as that is preconfigured to work seamlessly.

### Babel
We use Babel for transpiling ES6 syntax to any browser. Use JavaScript of the future is a breeze.

### Webpack
We use Webpack for bundling, compiling, and generating all assets needed for development and production. We have preconfigured configuration files to compress JS, bundling assets, and more. Unlike react-starter-kit, we don't require ejecting. Customize anything with complete control.
